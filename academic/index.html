      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Nitesh Ranjan Singh</strong>, a passionate and driven data professional currently pursuing an <strong>MSc in Data Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Glasgow</strong>. With over <strong>three years of experience as a Data Engineer</strong> in the pharmaceutical and healthcare analytics industry, I’ve designed and optimized large-scale ETL pipelines using technologies like <strong>Azure Data Factory</strong>, <strong>Databricks</strong>, <strong>PySpark</strong>, and <strong>Snowflake</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Data Science?</strong><br>
      My fascination with data began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, where I explored machine learning and built AI-based systems like <em>DigiAttendance</em> — a facial recognition attendance tracker. Over time, working at organizations like <strong>IQVIA</strong> and <strong>Axtria</strong>, I witnessed how impactful data can be in driving real-world decisions — especially in healthcare.
      This blend of technology, business context, and data-driven insight led me to pursue data science more deeply. I enjoy building systems that not only process data efficiently but also unlock hidden patterns and empower decision-makers.</p>

      <p><strong>Why the UK and the University of Glasgow?</strong><br>
      I chose the UK for its strong alignment with industry-focused academic programs, access to a vibrant tech ecosystem, and excellent post-study work opportunities. The University of Glasgow’s <strong>Data Science MSc program</strong> stood out to me for its well-balanced curriculum in big data analytics, cloud computing, and applied machine learning, backed by global faculty and research standards. Receiving a <strong>£10,000 Excellence Scholarship</strong> was both a recognition and a motivation to invest my full potential into this transformative journey.</p>

      <p><strong>Career Goals</strong><br>
      My short-term goal is to secure a <strong>data engineering internship in the UK</strong> during the summer of 2026, where I can apply my skills in Azure, Spark, and data pipeline design in a real-world setting.
      Long-term, I aspire to become a <strong>Data Engineering Lead or Solutions Architect</strong>, working at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and AI Ops — building scalable data products that serve both technical and business outcomes.</p>
