## 🔍 Why Data Science?

My fascination with data began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, where I explored machine learning and built AI-based systems like *DigiAttendance* — a facial recognition attendance tracker. Over time, working at organizations like **IQVIA** and **Axtria**, I witnessed how impactful data can be in driving real-world decisions — especially in healthcare.

This blend of **technology**, **business context**, and **data-driven insight** led me to pursue data science more deeply. I enjoy building systems that not only process data efficiently but also unlock hidden patterns and empower decision-makers.
